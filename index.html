    <h1><strong>DaDaFest at the Bluecoat, 8 - 30 March</strong></h1>
    <h1>The Bluecoat has a long relationship with DaDaFest, which marks its 40th birthday this year. This archive exhibition, on display in person at The Bluecoat this March, charts the arts centre’s partnership with this pioneering deaf and disability arts organisation that has played such an important role in the cultural life of Liverpool and far beyond. Part of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/6/edit?mid=1982Owdwbe7xfUzgCC3x5mLZkq3m4P5o&usp=sharing">DaDaFest International Art Map.</a></h1>

    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        This relationship began when DaDaFest’s precursor, North West Disability Arts Forum, supported a Bluecoat commission from artist Ann Whitehurst in 1994.  Several large-scale exhibition collaborations followed, including Senseless (2003), Niet Normaal (2012), and Art of the Lived Experiment (2014).    
    </a></p>
    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        When the Bluecoat significantly improved its physical access through a capital development, reopening in 2008, DaDaFest became one of our creative community tenants, which they remain today. Enhanced facilities also meant we were able to accommodate performances and events in a new auditorium upstairs and to be more involved in the annual (then biennial) festivals.     
    </a></p>
    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        Some of the highlights from these are represented here in photographs, programmes, posters and other material. Featured also are the Bluecoat’s inclusive arts group, Blue Room, who have been supported by DaDaFest and participated in many of its programmes.
